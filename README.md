# Sentiment-Analyzer
Update download.sh so that it works on the link in the file

## Plan
Dataset to use is Sentiment140, 1.6 million tweets each tagged with a sentiment 0-4

Stages (Do not need to complete all, especially last 3)
 - [ ] Create model (most likely LSTM) that trains and tests on dataset
 - [ ] Add visualization methods to model (Loss graph, Accuracy Graph, Validation loss/accuracy, Testing examples, etc.)
 - [ ] Fine tune model and record effects of changing hyperparameters, preprocessing methods, and training methods 
 - [ ] Link model to twitter bot that you can tweet at and it will respond with the sentiment 
 - [ ] Experiment with alternative models on the same dataset
 - [ ] Add generative model that from the given sentiment and context will generate a response

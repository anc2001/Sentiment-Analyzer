I'm really in love with the characters in this movie. It's amazing what the director was able to do with the cinematic design. Truly revolutionary. 

This movie was the worst. I can't believe people were paid to make this thing. Everything about it made me want to die. 

I want my money back

Kinda cringe ngl

I hate myself 

I really love my wife 

Everything in my life is going well right now. I feel really fulfilled

I don't know what that means

Sarcasm
Wow, could your loss graph get any higher? 
I actually look forward to long lines in the Ratty. It's really the highlight of my day.
